# MOOC-Learning-From-Data
My first introdution to Machine Learning online course MOOC (Learning From Data) from Caltech.

All my codings to generate solutions to the problem set problems can be found here.

My codes are written in Python, mostly using Numpy.

This course covers foundational theories of ML as well as practical algorithms for supervised ML.
